# Project3 - 3.1
add UIActivityViewController to previous project

Challenge:
Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.
Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
