# Project 14
Challenge:
Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
When showing “Game Over” add an SKLabelNode showing their final score.
Use SKEmitterNode to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.
