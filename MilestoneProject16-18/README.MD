# Project Milestone: Projects 16-18

Challenge:
How you implement this game really depends on what kind of shooting gallery games you’ve played in the past, but here are some suggestions to get you started:

Make some targets big and slow, and others small and fast. The small targets should be worth more points.
Add “bad” targets – things that cost the user points if they get shot accidentally.
Make the top and bottom rows move left to right, but the middle row move right to left.
Add a timer that ticks down from 60 seconds. When it hits zero, show a Game Over message.
Try going to https://openclipart.org/ to see what free artwork you can find.
Give the user six bullets per clip. Make them tap a different part of the screen to reload.
Those are just suggestions – it’s your game, so do what you like!
