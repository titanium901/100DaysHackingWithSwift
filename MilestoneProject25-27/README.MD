# Project Milestone: Projects 25-27

Challenge:
Your challenge for this milestone is to create a meme generation app using UIImagePickerController, UIAlertController, and Core Graphics. If you arenâ€™t familiar with them, memes are a simple format that shows a picture with one line of text overlaid at the top and another overlaid at the bottom.

Your app should:

Prompt the user to import a photo from their photo library.
Show an alert with a text field asking them to insert a line of text for the top of the meme.
Show a second alert for the bottom of the meme.
Render their image plus both pieces of text into one finished UIImage using Core Graphics.
Let them share that result using UIActivityViewController.
